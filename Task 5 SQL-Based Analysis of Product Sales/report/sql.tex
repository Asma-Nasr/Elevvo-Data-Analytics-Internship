\section{Introduction}
This report examines product sales data from the Chinook Database on Kaggle \cite{b1}. SQL queries will be used to address important business questions about top-selling items, regional revenue distribution, and monthly performance. The combination of product and sales information through JOINs will allow for a complete picture of sales trends. The purpose of this analysis is to offer practical information that can improve sales plans and how the business runs.


\section{Problem / Task Details}
Task 1 involves conducting an SQL-based analysis of product sales using the recommended Chinook Database from Kaggle. The objective is to utilize SQL queries to explore key business metrics, such as identifying top-selling products, determining revenue by region, and assessing monthly performance. This analysis will require writing JOIN statements to merge product and sales tables effectively. Participants will work with various SQL tools, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or BigQuery, while focusing on essential topics like SQL queries, JOINs, aggregations, and deriving business insights from raw data. Additionally, a bonus challenge includes employing a window function, such as ROW\_NUMBER or RANK, to enhance the analysis.



\section{Dataset Details}
The Chinook database is a substitute for the older Northwind database. It acts as a model of a digital media store, with connected tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. This design lets people manage and study data about digital media sales. It gives useful information about what customers want, how well sales are doing, and how much inventory is available. The Chinook database helps with SQL training and gives practical experience by showing a real-world example of a digital store \cite{b1}.

\section{SQL Queries}

\section{Conclusion}
This internship task used SQL analysis on the Chinook Database to find key insights about product sales. I ran queries to find top sellers, look at revenue by area, chart monthly patterns, and many more. The results showed customer behavior and typical invoice structures, giving a broad look at sales activity. This method, based on data, can help make smarter choices to boost sales and make operations better in the digital media space. Later studies might look at more specific groups of customers.
